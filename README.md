A opensource C# with steganography image logger builder | With nice ui and config and settings
If you like Zenith, feel free to star the repo and follow for more githubs like this that are cool tools that i make free :D

----------------------------------------

***Zenith Builder***

❓**What is Zenith**❓
Zenith Builder is a C# based open source image logger builder that uses steganography which is hiding code inside a image which can then built into a fake image. In C# this is possible to do. It basically builds the image that you have added to the path and adds the exe or stub whatever that you added and combines them into a fake .png which has steganography hidded into it. Making this pretty op

You can also send these to you friends by dragging the image to your friends in discord or whatever but it has to be from your file explorer because thats where it compiles to and cant be like an link or whatever

Also this tool is better then Image loggers out there like **Ice's** which is a python file
People also try to give me token grabber or built mercurials claming they are real image loggers
In effort of this, i just created a image builder that is 100% virus free and malware free
This took me a long time to make and has been one of my side projects i have been working although i was on a trip, i have finished this as one my projects as learning prior C#

I made it to prevent 9 year old kids from sending 15$ or 20$ on paypal or crypto to fake skids for "image loggers" and they just fucking block you

🌀 Zenith Builder has been released! (Added multiple webhooks and custom path to image logger, more to be added later on)




# 🌀 Zenith 🌀

**Zenith Builder** 
**Better** then any other discord image logger out there works easy.

- **Has custom image path**
- **Has custom stub link/download link path**
- **Has custom webhook options to add more or remove**
- **More to come soon!**



# Tutorial

**How to use it** for the 9 year olds **stop asking me on discord pls**

First download the zip file from the releases which is on your corner eye. Then open the zip and extract to anywhere.
Then double tap the **exe** and open it. Then you can click main and make sure that you have saved your image on your computer
and you stub link.

Then add your image and stub link path and enter your discord webhook, then it will compile into an png 

This is then a fake image with steganography! Now you can send it to anyone!
